## Digital Microprocessor Design Based on RV32I Instruction Set

### Independent Researcher | Zhejiang University | Sept. 2023 - Dec. 2023

1.Designed and programmed the digital circuits for a RISC-V microprocessor in Verilog and achieved 6 types and 40 core instructions of RV32I instruction set using this simulator.

2.Employed the 5-stage pipeline technique to implement the IF/ID/EX/MEM/WB execution hierarchy, realized techniques of forwarding and blocking to resolve data hazards.

3.Verified circuits design on the Nexys Video development system and achieved a CPU running speed of up to 25MHz.
